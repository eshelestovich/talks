= Reliability Testing

[quote, Edsger Dijkstra]
____
Program testing can be used to show the presence of bugs, but never to show their absence!

[quote, Leslie Lamport]
____
A distributed system is one in which the failure of a computer you didn't even know existed can render your own computer unusable.

== What is Reliability ?
The probability of failure-free software operation for a specified period of time in a specified environment.

* Fault-tolerant
* Highly available
* Scalable
* Secure
* Performant

== {conseal}

Ability to keep operating even if a component, or multiple components, fail.

== {conseal}

The outage will be brief because it will not take long to redeploy the required component.

You are saving your business by ditching your compromised infrastructure.

== {conseal}
image::scalability_failure.jpg[]
Ability of a system to handle a growing amount of work without a failure.

== What can go wrong
* Process (OOME, GC, Linux memory manager)
* Server (faulty hardware, power outage)
* Network (link down, split-brain, packets drop, high latency, firewall misconfig)
* Timing (clock skew, NTP misconfiguration)
* Byzantine failures (malicious packets, DDOS, wrong input, CSRF, etc)

== Things will crash
* Super reliable servers
* MTBF of 30 years
* 10 000 of those
* Watch one fail *per day*

== Hardware failures per year
* ~1000 individual machine failures
* thousands of hard drive failures
* ~20 rack failures (40-80 machines instantly disappear, 1-6 hours to get back)
* ~5 racks going wonky (10-20 machines seeing 50% packet loss)
* ~12 router reloads (takes out DNS and external vips for a couple minutes)
* ~8 network maintenances (30-minute random connectivity losses)
* slow disks, bad memory, misconfigured machines, etc

== Latency amplification
* Server with 1 ms avg but 1 sec P99 latency
* Touch 1 of these: 1% of requests take ≥1 sec
* Touch 100 of these: 63% of requests take ≥1 sec

== Software failures
